## Features

### Project and sponsorships overview

This feature allows for a tabular overview of sponsors, projects and extension requests for projects, and adding, editing and deleting the former mentioned entities.

### Sign in and sign up
Its possible to sign in to the app or register as a new user. There are two distinct user roles - one can be either a regular user or an admin. The admin role comes with special permission in the app - currently the only special action the admin can do is view the changes made in the app, but other funcions can easily be added.

### Managing sponsorships and programs
Using a form, a user can add a new program or sponsor which is saved to the database. Beneath the form is a table in which one can overview the existing endities and chose to edit or delete them. The tables can be sorted and filtered.

### Requesting an extension
A user can request an extension for a certain program, which opens a pop-up window where they can enter a number of days which they need to add to the due date. Thus sends an email to the sponsor where they can accept or deny the requet. Upon pressing the button, the status of the extension request is automatically updated.

### Exporting to .csv
The programs can be exported to a .csv file for ease of use, for example, in an Excel sheet.
